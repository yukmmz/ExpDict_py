Micro-bubbles  are  in  use  in  many  industrial  fields  such  as  water  treatment,  purification  of  lake  water,
chemical engineering, washing processes and housing equipment by virtues of their large interfacial area
concentration and long residence time in liquid. A pressurized dissolution method based on decompres-
sion of liquid with dissolved gas is one of promising methods for generating fine micro-bubbles at high
number  density.  Since  the  mechanism  of  micro-bubble  generation  is  not  clarified  yet,  design  and
improvement  of  micro-bubble  generators  are  based  on  trial  and  error.  In  this  study,  effects  of  liquid
volume  flux  at  a  decompression  nozzle  and  dissolved  gas  concentration  in  the  upstream  region  of  the
nozzle on diameter and number density of generated micro-bubbles are examined to understand gener-
ation  mechanism  of  micro-bubbles  in  a  pressurized  dissolution  method.  The  diameter  and  the  number
density of  micro-bubbles  are measured  by using phase  Doppler  anemometry  (PDA) in the downstream
region  of  the  nozzle,  and  the  flow  patterns  in  the  nozzle  are  visualized  by  using  a  high-speed  camera.
The  experimental  results  show  that  diameter  and  number  density  of  generated  micro-bubbles  depend
on  cavitation  pattern  at  the  nozzle,  and  that  cavitation  bubbles  containing  not  only  vapor  but  also
non-condensable  gas  become  micro-bubbles  due  to  their  shrink  caused  by  condensation  of  the  vapor
in the downstream region of the nozzle.

1. Introduction
Micro-bubbles are the bubbles with diameter ranging from one
to several hundred microns, and they are characterized by a large
interfacial area concentration per unit gas volume and low relative
velocity between the bubbles and liquid phase. These characteris-
tics are of great use in enhancement of adsorption of impurities at
gas?liquid  interface  and  mass  transfer  between  the  two  phases
[1,2]. Micro-bubbles are, therefore, utilized to improve efficiencies
and/or performances of various industrial systems such as chemi-
cal  reactors  [3],  water  treatment  systems  [4],  washing  processes
[5], medical systems [6], bathing systems [7] and plant cultivation
[8].  Since  efficiencies  and  performances  of  these  systems  depend
on the diameter and number density of micro-bubbles, it is impor-
tant to optimize them in development of the micro-bubble gener-
ators   [9,10]   and   to   understand   a   mechanism   of   micro-bubble
generation.
Various types of micro-bubble generators have been developed,
and  most  of  them  can  be  classified  into  four  methods,  i.e.,  the
method based on bubble breakup due to shear flow/pressure wave
(bubble  breakup  method  [11,12]),  the  method  using  ultrasonic
wave  (ultrasonic  method  [13,14]),  the  method  using  microflui-
dics/MEMS   technology   (microfluidic   method   [15?17])   and   the
method based on effervescence of dissolved gas due to depressur-
ization   at   a   decompression   nozzle   (a   pressurized   dissolution
method [18,19]). Although bubble breakup methods can generate
micro-bubbles  at  a  high  void  fraction,  the  diameter  of  generated
bubbles  ranges  widely  and  is  larger  than  the  other  methods.  The
number    densities    of    micro-bubbles    generated    by    ultrasonic
methods  and  microfluidic  methods  are  not  high  whereas  they
can generate mono-dispersed fine micro-bubbles. The pressurized
dissolution  methods can  generate  fine  micro-bubbles  with  a  high
bubble  number  density  which  is  preferable  in  many  industrial
applications   of   micro-bubbles,   though   they   require   relatively
higher  energy  consumption  to  generate  micro-bubbles  than  the
other methods.
We  therefore  focused  on  the  pressurized  dissolution  method
and  examined  influence  of  liquid  velocity  at  the  decompression
nozzle  throat  on  diameter  and  number  density  of  micro-bubbles
to  understand  the  mechanism  of  a  micro-bubble  generation  [20].
As  a  result,  it  was  found  that  micro-bubbles  are  generated  when

cavitation takes place in the decompression nozzle and the cavita-
tion plays an important role in the micro-bubble generation. Since
the dissolved gas concentration at the nozzle inlet is also an impor-
tant  parameter  of  micro-bubble  generation,  its  influence  on  the
diameter  and  number  density  of  generated  micro-bubbles  has  to
be examined to understand the generation mechanism. In the pres-
ent study, we therefore measure the diameter and number density
of micro-bubbles at the downstream region of the nozzle by using
phase  Doppler  anemometry  (PDA)  for  several  dissolved  gas  con-
centrations. Flow patterns in the nozzle are also observed by using
a   high-speed   video   camera.   Generation   mechanism   of   micro-
bubbles is discussed based on dependences of the mean diameter
and  number  density  on  the  liquid  velocity  and  the  dissolved  gas
concentration.
2. Experimental apparatus
Fig. 1 shows a schematic of the experimental apparatus which is
the same as the one in Hosokawa et al. [19] and Maeda et al. [20].
Water and air were used for the liquid and gas phases. Water was
stored in the lower tank and supplied by the pump to the dissolu-
tion  tank.  Air  was  supplied  by  the  compressor  and  mixed  with
water  in  the  dissolution  tank  shown  in  Fig.  2,  in  which  the  air
dissolved  into  the  water  through  the  air?water  interface.  Since
the  mass  transfer  rate  between  air  and  water  increases  with  the
gas?liquid  interfacial  area,  the  concentration  of  the  dissolved  air
was  controlled  by  changing  the  height  H  of  the  falling  film  (see
Appendix  A).  The  excess  air,  which  did  not  dissolve  into  water,
was  exhausted  from  the  top  of  the  dissolution  tank  through  the
exhaust valve. The water with dissolved air flowed into the decom-
pression nozzle shown in Fig. 3, the gap size, length and width of
which  were   1.0,  4.0   and  32.0 mm,  respectively.  Micro-bubbles
were  generated  by  decompression  at  the  nozzle.  Then,  the  water
with  micro-bubbles  flowed  into  the  vertical  rectangular  duct,  the
cross-section of which was 4  32 mm2. Photographs of generated
micro-bubbles are shown in Fig. 4. The water is opaque due to the
presence of a lot of fine micro-bubbles, whereas it is clean near the
bottom  of  the  beaker  due  to  decrease  in  micro-bubble  density
caused by buoyancy. The water flowed into the lower tank through
the upper tank. The micro-bubbles were released from the water to
the atmosphere through the water surface in the upper and lower
tanks, and no bubbles presented at the inlet of the decompression
nozzle. The water temperature was kept at 298 ± 0.5 K.
Experimental ranges of the liquid volumetric flux JL  at the noz-
zle  throat  and  the  mass  fraction  xGD   of  gasifiable  dissolved  gas  at
the   nozzle  inlet   were   JL = 10?14 m/s   and   xGD  = 0.0?1.69  105,
respectively. They are defined by

tion concentration of dissolved air at the atmospheric pressure and
q the  liquid  density.  C  was  evaluated  from  DO  at  the  nozzle  inlet
and the Henry’s law [19]. The DO at the nozzle inlet was measured
by a DO meter (HACH, LDO101-01  HQ30d), and the uncertainty in
DO was within ±0.2 mg/L. The uncertainties estimated at 95% confi-
dence in measured JL  and xGD   were less than 3%.
Since cavitation occurred at the nozzle throat, the flow pattern
in  the  nozzle  was  recorded  by  a  high  speed  video  camera  (Red
Lake,  motion  Pro  HS-1).  The  visualized  region  is  shown  in  Fig.  3.
The  frame  rate  and  the  exposure  time  were  5000 Hz  and  9 ls,
respectively.
Diameters of micro-bubbles were measured at 250 mm down-
stream of the nozzle exit (Fig. 3) by using phase Doppler anemom-
etry (PDA, DANTEC 60X, particle size measurement accuracy 4%,
particle  velocity  measurement  accuracy  1%).  The  Sauter  mean

nel  at  250 mm  downstream  of  the  nozzle  through  a  preliminary
experiment.

graphs of the flow patterns in the decompression nozzle at differ-
ent  JL.  When  JL  is  lower  than  10.5 m/s,  cavitation  does  not  occur
(NC:  no  cavitation).  Cavitation  inception  occurs  near  the  nozzle
inlet  between  JL = 10.5  and  11.0 m/s,  and  bubble  cavitation  (BC)
is observed for JL = 11.0?12.5 m/s. In BC conditions, vapor bubbles
are generated and grow near the leading edge of the nozzle. They
shrink  due  to  pressure  recovery  in  the  rear  part  of  the  nozzle  as
they  flow  downstream.  The  number  of  bubbles  in  the  cavitation
region increases with JL. The flow pattern transits from BC to sheet
cavitation (SC) between JL = 12.5 and 13.0 m/s. In SC condition, the
vapor film covering the nozzle throat is formed, and it breaks into
the vapor bubbles at the nozzle exit. The generated vapor bubbles
shrink  due  to  condensation  caused  by  pressure  recovery  as  the
bubbles flow downstream.
The  bubble  number  density  nB  and  the  Sauter  mean  diameter
d32   measured  in  the  downstream  region  of  the  nozzle  tend  to
increase  with  JL  as  shown  in  Fig.  6.  Since  the  number  density  in
NC  regime  is  very  low,  micro-bubble  generation  is  insignificant
in NC regime. This shows that cavitation is required for micro-bub-
ble  generation.  The  relation  between  nB   and  JL   well  corresponds
with  flow  patterns,  that  is,  nB  is  almost  zero  in  NC  regime  and  it
increases with JL  in BC regime, in which the number density of cav-
itation bubbles in the nozzle throat also increases with JL  as shown
in Fig. 5. On the other hand, nB does not depend on JL so much in SC
regime, in which the condition of vapor film is not sensitive to JL. As
to the diameter of micro-bubbles, d32  takes the minimum value in
BC regime and it increases with JL in SC regime. These results imply
that  the  generation  of  micro-bubbles  depends  on  cavitation  pat-
terns at the decompression nozzle. The experiments with different
pressure conditions at the nozzle had been carried out by changing
the length of the vertical duct in the downstream region of the noz-
zle.  The  results  clearly  showed  that  the  cavitation  condition  and
the  characteristic  of  the  generated  micro  bubbles  depend  not  on
JL  but  on  the  cavitation  number  at  the  nozzle  which  is  a  function
of  JL   and  the  pressure  at  the  nozzle.  The  cavitation  numbers  in
the  present  experimental  setup  are  0.99,  0.82,  0.67,  0.54,  0.43,
0.33,  0.24  and  0.16  for  JL = 10.5,  11.0,  11.5,  12.0,  12.5,  13.0,  13.5
and  14.0 m/s,  respectively.  The  details  can  be  found  in  Maeda
et al. [20]. The JL  is however used hereafter for easy understanding,
since the pressure  at  the nozzle is  almost constant in  the present
experiments.
3.2. Influence of dissolved gas concentration
The photographs of flow pattern in the decompression nozzle at
various xGD   are shown in Fig. 7. The flow pattern does not depend
on xGD   not only in SC regime but also in BC regime. We confirmed
through  preliminary  tests  that  the  transition  from  SC  to  BC  also
does not depend on xGD  so much in the present experimental range.
This  might  be  because  the  concentration  of  vapor  in  cavitation
bubbles is much higher than that of dissolved gas at the transition
condition between SC and BC, and therefore, xGD   is not significant
in  the  transition  whereas  several  literatures  (e.g.  Crum  [21]  and
Leighton  [22])  have  reported  that  cavitation  inception  depends
on the dissolved gas concentration. The number of micro-bubbles
in  the  downstream  region  of  the  nozzle  tends  to  increase  with
xGD  in both regimes, and it is higher in SC regime than in BC regime.
The  number  density  and  Sauter  mean  diameter  measured  by
PDA are shown  in Fig.  8. The bubble number density nB  increases
with  xGD   at  JL = 12 m/s  (BC  regime)  as  shown  in  Fig.  8(a).  On  the
other  hand,  its  increase  is  not  large  at  JL = 14 m/s  (SC  regime).

The Sauter mean diameter d32  increases with xGD  in both JL  cases as
shown  in  Fig.  8(b).  The  diameter d32  for  JL = 14 m/s (SC  regime) is
larger than those for JL = 12 m/s (BC regime) at any xGD, and the gra-
dient of d32 with respect to xGD  for the former is higher than the lat-
ter.  These  differences  in  dependences  of  nB  and  d32  on  xGD   imply
that  micro-bubble  generation  process  in  BC  regime  is  different
from that in SC regime. Judging from Fig. 7(b), the breakup of vapor
film forms vapor bubbles at the nozzle exit and micro-bubbles may
be generated by shrink of the vapor bubbles in SC regime. Since the
generation of vapor bubbles by breakup of vapor film depends not
on xGD  but on the hydrodynamic force acting on the vapor film, the
weak dependence of nB  on xGD  in SC regime is consistent with this
generation process. Micro-bubbles in BC regime may be also gener-
ated  from  the  cavitation  bubbles.  Hence,  the  increase  in  nB  with
respect to xGD  implies that the number of vapor bubbles generated
in the cavitation region increases with xGD  in BC regime. Sakashita
et al. [23] reported a similar phenomenon, i.e., increase in nB  with
the concentration  of  2-pentanol in water  in a boiling experiment.
This shows the possibility of increase in bubble nucleation due to
the presence of dissolvent molecules. At JL = 14 m/s, micro-bubbles
are generated even at xGD  = 0, that is, at the saturation concentra-
tion  at  atmospheric  pressure.  This  indicates  that  micro-bubbles
can  be  generated  even  when  the  dissolved  gas  concentration  is
lower  than  the  saturated  concentration  at  atmospheric  pressure
provided that sheet cavitation takes place in the nozzle.
Effects of xGD  on the probability density functions P(dB) of dB  for
JL = 12  and  14 m/s  are  shown  in  Fig.  9(a)  and  (b),  respectively.  At
JL = 12 m/s  (BC  regime),  the  ratio  of  bubbles  smaller  than  10 lm
slightly  decreases  as  xGD    increases,  and  that  larger  than  10 lm
increases  with  xGD.  This  corresponds  to  the  increase  in  d32   with
xGD   shown  in  Fig.  8(b).  This  trend  is  clearer  in  SC  regime,  that  is,
the ratio of bubbles smaller than 15 lm decreases and that larger
than 15 lm increases as xGD  increases. The increase in bubble num-
ber at each bubble diameter range is not clear from the comparison
of  P(dB)  due  to  the  difference  in  nB   among  the  flow  conditions.
Fig.   10   shows   the  product  of   the   probability   density   function
P(dB) and the bubble number density nB, that is, the number den-
sity of bubbles in each diameter range. At JL = 12 m/s (BC regime),
nBP(dB) increases with xGD  in all diameter ranges. That is, the num-
ber  of  bubbles  in  each  diameter  range  increases  with  xGD.  Unlike
the   result   for   JL = 12 m/s,   change   in   nBP(dB)   is   not   large   at
JL = 14 m/s (SC regime). It slightly increases in the range of dB > 15 -
lm   and   slightly   decreases   in   the   range   of   dB < 15 lm   as   xGD
increases.  If  the  size  distribution  of  vapor  bubbles  generated  by
breakup of a vapor film does not depend on xGD   in SC regime, the
distribution  of  nBP(dB)  of  micro-bubbles  generated  by  shrink  of
the  vapor  bubble  may  shift  to  larger  dB   as  xGD   increases  due  to
increase in the amount of non-condensable gas in the vapor bub-
bles.  This  speculation  is  supported  by  the  result  for  JL = 14 m/s
shown in Fig. 10(b).
Fig.  11  shows  the  effect  of  xGD    on  the  volume  fraction  aB   of
micro-bubbles. The volume fraction was calculated by

JL = 14 m/s is  well fitted  by a  linear function. This  indicates  that hB
increases linearly with xGD, since nB  at JL = 14 m/s is weakly depen-
dent on xGD. Concentration of non-condensable gas in vapor bubbles
separated from a vapor film will be proportional to xGD, and the size
of the vapor bubbles depends not on xGD  but on JL  since their gener-
ation is due to hydrodynamic forces acting on the vapor film. Hence,
this result is consistent with micro-bubble generation by shrinking
vapor  bubbles separated from  the vapor  film formed by  cavitation
in the nozzle. On the other hand, the increase at JL = 12 m/s is well
fitted by a quadratic curve. This implies that not only hB  but also nB
linearly increase with xGD. The linear increase in hB  is similar to that
in SC regime, i.e., due to linear increase in concentration of non-con-
densable gas in vapor bubbles. The increase in nB  with xGD  indicates
increase in bubble nucleation in BC regime.
3.3. Generation mechanism of micro-bubbles
Based on the above results, the generation mechanism of micro-
bubbles  in  the  pressurized  dissolution  method  is  summarized  as
follows (Fig. 12). When bubble cavitation takes place in the decom-
pression nozzle, vapor bubbles are generated in the inlet region of
the nozzle as shown in Fig. 12(a). The cavitation bubbles consist of
not only vapor  but also  non-condensable  gas  (air),  which are  dis-
solved  in  water  in  the  upstream  region  of  the  nozzle.  The  vapor
in  the  cavitation  bubble  condenses  due  to  pressure  recovery  in
the  downstream of  the  nozzle,  and  therefore,  the  diameter  of  the
cavitation  bubble  rapidly  decreases.  On  the  other  hand,  non-con-
densable  gas  in  the  bubbles  remains  and  forms  micro-bubbles  in
the   downstream   region.   Increase   in   xGD    causes   increase  in   an
amount of non-condensable gas in the vapor bubbles, i.e., increase
in  the  diameters  of  micro-bubbles,  since  the  amount  of  dissolved
gas locating near the vaporizing water increases with xGD  and they
form   cavitation   bubbles   together   with   vaporized   water.   The
increase  in  xGD   also  increases  the  number  of  nucleation of  cavita-
tion bubbles, i.e., the number density of micro-bubbles.
When  sheet  cavitation  takes  place  in  the  nozzle,  vapor  films
containing vapor and non-condensable gas are formed in the noz-
zle as shown in Fig. 12(b). The vapor films break at the nozzle exit
due  to  hydrodynamic  forces  acting  on  them,  and  vapor  bubbles
containing non-condensable gas are generated in the downstream
region of the nozzle. The vapor in the bubble condenses rapidly and
non-condensable    gas    forms    micro-bubbles.    Increase    in    xGD
increases  an  amount  of  non-condensable  gas  in  the  vapor  film
and the vapor bubbles, and therefore, the diameters of micro-bub-
bles  increase  with  xGD.  Since  the  vapor  bubbles  are  generated  by

collapse of the vapor film due to hydrodynamic forces, the bubble
number density does not depend on xGD  so much. Since the micro-
bubble generation is based on cavitation at the nozzle, few micro-
bubbles   are   generated   when   cavitation   does   not   occur   at   the
nozzle.
4. Conclusions
Diameters and number densities of micro-bubbles generated by
a  pressurized  dissolution  method  were  measured  by  using  phase
Doppler  anemometry  to  examine  influence  of  dissolved  gas  con-
centrations  in  the  upstream  region  of  the  decompression  nozzle.
Flow  patterns  in  the  nozzle  were  also  observed  by  using  a  high-
speed   video   camera.   Generation   mechanism   of   micro-bubbles
was  discussed  based  on  the  experimental  results.  As  a  result,  we
confirmed  that  (1)  micro-bubbles  are  generated  when  cavitation
takes  place  in  the  decompression  nozzle,  (2)  the  Sauter  mean
diameter d32  of micro-bubbles increases as the dissolved gas con-
centration  xGD    increases,  and  (3)  the  bubble  number  density  nB
increases with xGD  in bubble cavitation regime, whereas its depen-
dency on xGD   is low in sheet cavitation regime. These results indi-
cate   that   micro-bubbles   are   generated   by   shrink   of   cavitation
bubbles  involving  not  only  vapor  but  also  non-condensable  gas
which are  originally  dissolved  in  water  in  the  upstream  region  of
the nozzle. The amount of the non-condensable gas in a cavitation
bubble  increases  with  xGD,  and  therefore,  d32   increases  with  xGD.
The  different  trend  in  nB   between  bubble  and  sheet  cavitation
regimes is caused by difference in the generation process of cavita-
tion bubbles, that is, the bubbles are directly generated by cavita-
tion  in  bubble  cavitation  regime  whereas  they  are  generated  by
breakup of vapor films in sheet cavitation regime.

Appendix A
The  concentration  of  dissolved  air  was  controlled  by  changing
the  height  H  of  the  falling  film  shown  in  Fig.  2.  Fig.  A1  shows  a
relation  between  H  and  the  concentration  DO  of  dissolved  oxy-
gen  measured  at  the  exit  of  the  dissolution  tank  which  is  the
same   concentration   at   the   nozzle   inlet.   The   flow   conditions,
JL = 12  and  14 m/s,  are  the  typical  JL   conditions  for  the  bubble
cavitation  and  sheet  cavitation  at   the  nozzle,  respectively.  DO
increases  with  H  for  each  JL  due  to  the  increase  in  the  gas?liquid
interfacial  area  through  which  air  dissolves  into  water.  DO  also
increases  with  JL  due  to  the  increase  in  the  pressure  in  the  tank.
This  result  shows  that  the  concentration  of  dissolved  air  is  con-
trollable  with  H.
